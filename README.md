For this project, a website called "Skin Glow" was created as an online store. Users may view skincare products, register as a customer, login, add a product to their cart, and purchase products. 
In addition to website design, this project will show how attackers may use vulnerabilities often present in websites' code to launch an SQLi attack. 
Moreover, this project will implement filtering, sanitizing, and prepared statements techniques to prevent SQLi attacks, ensuring the website becomes more secure and less prone to SQLi attacks.
